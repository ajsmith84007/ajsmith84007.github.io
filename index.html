							<h2>My Profile</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Background</strong> I am currently a Construction Manager for the NBN rollout across Victoria.
My interest in IT started many years ago. From the time I picked up my first PC World magazine in 1997 and read it from cover to cover, I knew I was hooked on technology and everything it offered.
Getting a Dial-up Internet connection to my house was of huge excitement although having it disconnect every time the phone rang was frustrating, as well as my parents restricting my Internet time to 1 hour per night. From here I learned how to build home computers and it wasn’t long before I had pulled apart and reassembled every PC I could get my hands on. Moving into high school and beyond, as technology progressed I become much more invested in IT. I could now build new PC’s and was learning about networking and basic programming.
I became an Industrial Electrician and this opened up a new world of IT that I never new existed. I was now learning about machine Automation and programming in machine code such as C++ and Ladder Logic. I learned how to setup Industrial grade networking solutions, provided server installation and management through Windows Server 2003 and Linux. 
I choose to enrol in RMIT because in my current role with NBN I have seen many changes in our network infrastructure and I can see there will be many more improvements in networking and connectivity of everything to the internet in the coming years. I am completing the RMIT modules as a gateway into the IT degrees pathway and I’m hoping this will enable me to enrol in a full IT Degree next year.
I am hoping to learn about Java programming as this is an area I have never looked at before. Also the general knowledge of how the IT industry works and what opportunities there are in the future for trained professionals.</p>

							<p><strong>Employment Opportunities</strong> 
A currently advertised role I would be interested in is Cyber Security Penetration Tester.
This role involves the use a variety of network penetration and probing tools to look for vulnerabilities in a client’s network and IT infrastructure. Employee must then provide a detailed report of issues found in the network as well as propose solutions for closing vulnerabilities and gaps in the network security. This is highly appealing to me as it would test my knowledge of network systems and provide the opportunity to work in the Cyber Security industry.
This role requires knowledge of web-based penetration testing tools utilizing multiple programming languages including JAVA, Node JS, Angular and SAP. The position includes an on-site assessment that requires a skill showcase on live networks and the candidate’s ability to successfully penetrate the client’s network. There will also be a requirement to demonstrate knowledge of enterprise level networking systems running on various platforms including windows and Linux.
My plan in applying for this role in the future would be the completion of an IT degree at university level. Additional training on Networking tools and platforms such as Cisco Certification training and Microsoft Certification courses. Having a background in Enterprise level Industrial Networks would definitely be an advantage for clients running large scale systems. I would like to learn more about web-based network penetration tools as an option for working off-site and attempting to gain access to a client’s network remotely.

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Overview</strong> To utilize the Raspberry Pi portable computer as a way of accessing corporate networks for the purpose of network penetration testing. The handy ultraportable discreet device has the ability to hide in plain site inside a business or office with general staff possibly being unaware of its attachment to the corporate network. With Linux loaded onto the Raspberry Pi it should be possible to act as a gateway to the corporate network and provide remote access to the penetration tester. </p>


							<!-- Section -->
								<section>
									<header>
										<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Motivation</strong> The main goal of this project is to provide businesses and even home users with detailed reports outlining where their Network Security risks are. In the age of almost every business and home being connected to the internet, it is more important than ever to have your private data and internal networks secure from hackers and malicious software. The raspberry Pi would also be used to demonstrate the ease of social engineering as a hacking tool. Most office staff are all to willing to let complete strangers into their building, especially if that person is wearing hi-vis clothing or looks like a tradesperson. At this point the hacker could install the Raspberry Pi discreetly under a desk or even the Server Room, providing themselves with an internal gateway to the network. This solution will often bypass External Facing Firewalls and port blockers as devices connected internally are deemed safe for Server access. </p>

							<p><strong>Description</strong> Although my project is based on methods already deployed by other network penetration testing companies throughout the world, 1 key difference that I would like to deploy is training seminars and engagement with the IT teams of businesses and even home users as to how to better secure their networks and private information from people attempting to steal information. I believe with targeted and relevant training aimed at all internet users, could be a huge benefit in securing data.
I propose each Raspberry Pi would be given to the customer at the end of the training sessions, with some goals set for the customer to test their own network with tools provided and ensure they are safe from further attacks. I believe this is a unique solution that is not yet readily available to businesses or home users and people are unaware of how at risk their data is.
A raspberry Pi loaded with software such as Kali Linux which is a powerful penetration tool, one that can be utilized to remotely access any network it is attached to. Kali Linux Operating system builds that are readily available online and can come pre-loaded with numerous network penetration tools. From simple port scanners to blunt force password attacks on protected server content, the options available on Linux are limitless. Due to Linux being an open source platform, the ability to create your own tools and install them onto a distribution with no cost. This a huge benefit at keeping overheads low on a start-up network security businesses. </p>

							<p><strong>Tools & Technology</strong> The hardware requirements are simply a Raspberry Pi which is a very low-cost computer platform.
The software loaded onto this device would be KALI Linux which already has numerous networking penetration tools available for testing.

										<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Skills Required</strong> Skills required for this project would be an in depth understanding of KALI Linux software. General knowledge of Raspberry Pi hardware and the ability to put together training packages that can be aimed at different levels of learners. i.e. IT professionals and Server admins vs general home users and or tech savvy individuals. </p>

										<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Outcome</strong> This project has the potential to create a new business opportunity with the ideal outcome being successfully deployed network security consultant, who would promote the business to potential clients throughout the country. The impact of this business in an internet of things connected world could be huge, people need more education and training into how to protect themselves online. We all hear of that friend or colleague that has had their identity stolen or credit card information stolen. To even in worse case scenarios where businesses are held ransom from millions of dollars as there data is locked away behind a crypto pay wall. 
The main purpose and ideal outcome for this project would be a better education of how at-risk networks and computer systems can be. A Networking security business that is able to provide low-cost tailored solutions to individuals and IT Support staff, with customised training packages that offer different content depending on the target demographic. </p>
